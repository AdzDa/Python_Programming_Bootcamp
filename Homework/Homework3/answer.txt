 Reading Questions

 1. What is a nested loop?

        Nested loop is where there is/ are another loop(s) inside a loop

2. Which kind of loop is based on a conditional statement: while loops or for loops?

        "which" loop is based on a conditional statement or the boolean condition; whereby, if the condition is true then the loop will start/ keep executing.

3. When you want to iterate a specific number of times, would you typically use a while loop or a for loop?

        It's better to use "for" loop if we already know how much we want to iterate

4. Is it possible to loop through a string one letter at a time? What is the example given in the article?

        Yes, it's possible. The example given from the article is as follows:

            sammy = 'Sammy'

            for letter in sammy:
            print(letter)

        Where, the output would be:

            S
            a
            m
            m
            y


5. Extrapolate from what you learned in the articles: Do you think a for loop be nested inside a while loop? Why or why not?

        Yes, "for" loop can be inside the "while" loop; and it is still considered as nested loop. The example could be done is as follow:

        Source code:
            i=0 
            while i<6:
                for j in range(i):
                    print("*",end=' ')
                print()
                i +=1
        
        Output:
            * 
            * * 
            * * * 
            * * * * 
            * * * * *
